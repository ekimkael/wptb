# WPTB

**WPTB** is [**Wordpress**](http://wordpress.org/) theme development scaffolding tool

## why?

For some time now I've been working a lot on the creation of wordpress themes. I used to create each theme manually for a long time but with time it became repetitive so I decided to create this little tool to help me.

**It's on Node because I'm basically a javascript developer.**

## How?

You need to have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) install on your computer and then install globally _wptb_:

`npm install -g wptb`

once you have it installed, you will be able to run the command: `wptb` preferably in the wordpress themes folder
