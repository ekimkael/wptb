# WPTB

**WPTB** is a [**Wordpress**](https://developer.wordpress.org/) theme development scaffolding tool.

## why?

For some time now I've been working a lot on the creation of wordpress themes. I used to create each theme manually for a long time but with time it became repetitive so I decided to create this little tool to help me.

**It's on Node because I'm basically a javascript developer.**

## How?

You need to have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) install on your computer and then install globally **wptb**:

`npm install -g wptb`

once you have it installed, you will be able to run the command: `wptb`

preferably in the wordpress themes folder.

The theme that you will generate includes support for some basic Wordpress features such as

- support for `title-tag`
- support for menus
- support for post thumbnails

## Bugs

for now, when the tool displays a `.DS_Store` when displaying different templates.
